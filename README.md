Jekyll Clean
============

A simple and clean Jekyll theme using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
(not to be confused with jekyll-bootstrap) that's easy to modify and very
modular in component and element reuse.

It uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support. Both of
these features are disabled by default and can be enabled via \_config.yml. You
can also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html).
The beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean... Jekyll Clean!

The theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the
sidbar.

Don't forget to occassionally rebase against my upstream repository so you can get
the latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!
