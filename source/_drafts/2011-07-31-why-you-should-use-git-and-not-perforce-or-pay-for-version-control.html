I've used a number of version control solutions in my career - SCCS, RCS, CVS, PVCS, Clearcase, svn, perforce, and git. Plus a few more in there that I can't remember (probably for good reason). My experiences with these system vary from horrific (PVCS) to incredibly awesome (git).<br /><br />This blog entry focuses on why you should use git, and not perforce, which you have to pay hundreds of dollars per user for.<br /><br />centralized vs distributed<br />mother-may-i vs enabling<br />client spec<br />branch spec<br />branching should be free<br />can do whatever I want locally, and when pushed I get my FULL history<br />maven integration (and why)<br />empty commits<br /><br />git repos are free and easy<br />don't forget to back them up</div>
