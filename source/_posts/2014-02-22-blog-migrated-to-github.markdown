This blog is now being hosted on github pages using [octopress](http://octopress.org).

A large part of the reason for this is diversification away from Google. As much
as I love Google for many reasons (and will continue to be a faithful Android
user for the near future), I am moving most of my assets off Google infrastructure.

I'll write more about the reasons for this later, as well as mention which services
I've migrated to (email, search, browser, etc).
