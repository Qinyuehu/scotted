If you are interested in the history of Atari, I would encourage you to grab a copy of "<b>Atari Inc. Business Is Fun</b>" by Curt Vendel and Marty Goldberg. This is a <b>big</b> book - 800 pages of narrative, pictures, and internal documents that tell the unabridged history of this pioneer video game company. What Atari was doing in the 70s and early 80s shaped not only the video game industry, but the entire computer industry.<br /><br />As an added bonus, there's even a picture of me in this book! My father was an engineer for Atari from the beginning until the fall of Atari in 1984.<br /><br />Go grab yourself a copy by clicking below - you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />&nbsp;   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985597402/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&tag=sail2software-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0985597402"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0985597402&MarketPlace=US&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=sail2software-20&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=sail2software-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0985597402" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />  <div class="blogger-post-footer">Please visit our site at http://sail2software.com.
